# Code Review for AS400 Source Code

## General Comments
The provided code is a comprehensive set of AS400 source code files, including physical files, logical files, display files, RPG programs, and CL programs. The code appears to be well-structured and follows standard AS400 coding practices. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance readability, maintainability, and performance. Below are detailed comments categorized by severity.

## Comments

### High Severity

1. **Hardcoded Values**:
   - **File**: `./MNU003CL.txt`
   - **Lines**: 14, 15
   - **Comment**: The output queue (`OUTQ`) is hardcoded to 'PRT01'. This should be parameterized or configurable to allow flexibility.
   - **Example**:
     ```rpg
     DCL VAR(&OUTQ) TYPE(*CHAR) LEN(10) VALUE('PRT01')
     ```
   - **Recommendation**: Use a configuration file or a database table to store such values.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - **File**: `./RPG_PROGRAMS.txt`
   - **Lines**: 1234-1240
   - **Comment**: The error handling in the `ChangeOutQ` subroutine is minimal and does not provide detailed feedback to the user.
   - **Example**:
     ```rpg
     If %Error
       Eval Msg_ID = 'BZL0052'
       ExSR WriteMsg
       Eval OutQueError = *On
       Eval Function = 'Dsplay'
     EndIf
     ```
   - **Recommendation**: Enhance error handling to provide more context and possibly log errors for further analysis.

3. **Security Checks**:
   - **File**: `./RPG_PROGRAMS.txt`
   - **Lines**: 567-580
   - **Comment**: The security checks are scattered and not centralized, making it difficult to manage and update security policies.
   - **Example**:
     ```rpg
     If MNUHIDE <> 'N' and MNAHIDE <> 'Y'
       Eval ThisAuth = *Off
     Else
       AuthKey Chain(N) SCDATA4
       If %Found(SCDATA4) or AllAuth = *On
         Eval ThisAuth = *On
       Else
         Eval ThisAuth = *Off
       EndIf
     EndIf
     ```
   - **Recommendation**: Centralize security checks into a single subroutine or module to ensure consistency and ease of maintenance.

### Medium Severity

4. **Code Duplication**:
   - **File**: `./RPG_PROGRAMS.txt`
   - **Lines**: 234-250, 345-360
   - **Comment**: There is duplicated logic for handling menu options and user inputs.
   - **Example**:
     ```rpg
     If MNUHIDE = 'P' and PgmUser = *Off
       Eval ShowThis = *Off
     Else
       Eval ShowThis = *On
     EndIf
     ```
   - **Recommendation**: Refactor the duplicated code into reusable subroutines or functions.

5. **Magic Numbers**:
   - **File**: `./Screens.txt`
   - **Lines**: 45, 67, 89
   - **Comment**: The use of magic numbers for screen positions and attributes reduces readability.
   - **Example**:
     ```rpg
     A  59 CF03(03 'Initial Menu')
     A  57 CF12(12 'Cancel')
     ```
   - **Recommendation**: Define constants for these values to improve readability and maintainability.

6. **Inconsistent Naming Conventions**:
   - **File**: `./RPG_PROGRAMS.txt`
   - **Lines**: 123, 456, 789
   - **Comment**: Variable and subroutine names are inconsistent, making the code harder to follow.
   - **Example**:
     ```rpg
     D Msg_Act S 1
     D Msg_Id S 10
     D Msg_Data S 75
     ```
   - **Recommendation**: Adopt a consistent naming convention for variables and subroutines.

### Low Severity

7. **Comments and Documentation**:
   - **File**: `./CopyBook.txt`
   - **Lines**: 10, 20, 30
   - **Comment**: Some sections of the code lack comments and documentation, making it difficult for new developers to understand the logic.
   - **Example**:
     ```rpg
     D UT0500 PR ExtPgm('UT0500')
     D P_Act 1
     D P_MsgId 10
     ```
   - **Recommendation**: Add comments and documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.

8. **Unused Variables**:
   - **File**: `./RPG_PROGRAMS.txt`
   - **Lines**: 567, 678, 789
   - **Comment**: There are several unused variables in the code, which can lead to confusion and potential errors.
   - **Example**:
     ```rpg
     D UnusedVar S 10
     ```
   - **Recommendation**: Remove unused variables to clean up the code.

9. **Formatting and Indentation**:
   - **File**: `./RPG_PROGRAMS.txt`
   - **Lines**: 123, 234, 345
   - **Comment**: The code formatting and indentation are inconsistent, making it harder to read.
   - **Example**:
     ```rpg
     If Condition
     Eval Value = 1
     Else
     Eval Value = 2
     EndIf
     ```
   - **Recommendation**: Use a consistent formatting and indentation style throughout the code.

### Informational

10. **Use of Deprecated Functions**:
    - **File**: `./RPG_PROGRAMS.txt`
    - **Lines**: 1234, 5678
    - **Comment**: The code uses some deprecated functions that may not be supported in future versions.
    - **Example**:
      ```rpg
      Call 'QCMDEXC'
      Parm Command
      Parm CmdLen
      ```
    - **Recommendation**: Review and update the code to use modern and supported functions.

## Summary
The provided AS400 source code is generally well-structured but can benefit from improvements in error handling, security checks, code duplication, and consistency. Addressing these issues will enhance the readability, maintainability, and performance of the code.
